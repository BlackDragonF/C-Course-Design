# C-Course-Design

### This is homework for students in HUST majored in Computer Science.

###This homework includes two parts - Part I requires you to make an information manage system based on linked lists, while Part II has four problems in total, varying from making your own IO library to implement a assembler and a simulator based on given Instruction Set Architecture(ISA).

###Here I finished IO library and assembler/simulator in Part II.

##AntiCorruptionSystem(ACS)

***

###This is an information manage system on corruption cases with gtk2.It can perform on Windows/MacOS/Linux.

##MyIO

***

###This is a worse substitude for "stdio.h" - I only partly implement gets/puts/scanf(limited functions)/printf(limited functions)

##Assembler and Simulator

***

###This is an assembler and simulator for a 8086-like architecture, where the origin of this problem is from Cornell University.
